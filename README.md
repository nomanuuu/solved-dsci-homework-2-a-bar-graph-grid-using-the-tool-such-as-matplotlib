<br>
This assignment is to practice creating a bar graph grid using the tool such as MatPlotLib with Taipeiâ€™s traffic accident data from year 101 (2012) to 108 (2019). The files we provide are the data files (xxxTraffic accident.csv) of eight years and a correspondence table for mapping codes to certain fields (Traffic accident chart.csv). In the data file, there are fifteen attributes, including <em>Year</em>, <em>Month</em>, <em>Day</em>, <em>Hour</em>, <em>Minute</em>, <em>Processing class</em>, <em>death toll</em>, <em>Injuries Person</em>, <em>Vehicle </em><em>type</em>, <em>Sex</em>, <em>Age</em>, <em>Weather</em>, <em>Speed limit</em>, <em>Road pattern</em>, <em>Accident </em><em>location</em>. With the data files and table, your homework should be done according to the following <strong>requirements</strong>:

<ul>

 <li>There are six main topics to be shown in each year:

  <ol>

   <li>Number of traffic accident death toll per month</li>

   <li>Number of traffic accident injuries per month</li>

   <li>Number of traffic accident injuries per vehicle type (take the top 10)</li>

   <li>Number of traffic accident injuries per weather</li>

   <li>Number of traffic accident injuries per road pattern (take the top 10) 6. Number of traffic accident injuries per accident location (take the top 10)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Each topic will be presented by a bar chart.</li>

 <li>For each year, use bar graph grid to show the six topics. Thus, there will be eight grids for years and each grid has six bar charts for each topic.</li>

 <li>On the other hand, please produce the grids for the six topics respectively. Each grid will have eight bar charts for the eight years.</li>

 <li>Please do not forget, in each chart, to have the topic on the top and label the x-axis and y-axis.</li>

</ul>
